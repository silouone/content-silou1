Comment trouver le bonheur ? Est-ce compatible avec les obligations de la vie quotidienne ? Eh bien, ce cours ne vise pas à répondre à ces questions, mais à mettre en place des habitudes susceptibles de favoriser le bonheur au travail. Embarquons pour un tour de tapis volant à travers les contrées du management des rituels, de la conscience de la mort et de l’apprentissage continu avec les démonstrations hilarantes mais sérieuses de Videos arts."
